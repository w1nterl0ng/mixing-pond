Next, we use slides to make a linear shift. We start in the seventh (VII) position, slide up to the ninth (IX).  Then back to the VII and finally end on the sixth (VI) position.

## Why This Book is Needed
While many guitar instruction books touch on legato techniques, few offer a comprehensive system for mastering and applying these techniques across the entire fretboard. This book fills that gap by introducing a unique approach to linear fretboard connection, focusing on horizontal movement across strings to create fluid, uninterrupted phrases. The interval-based method presented here enables guitarists to break free from conventional box patterns, offering a new perspective on fretboard navigation that is often overlooked in traditional guitar education. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this book provides a structured approach to developing a smooth, legato style applicable to any genre, transforming players' understanding of the fretboard into tangible improvements in their playing and opening up new creative possibilities for soloing and improvisation.

## About the Author
Fred Anderson is a veteran guitarist and educator with over 30 years of professional playing and teaching experience.

Fred's extensive background in performance and instruction has allowed him to develop and refine the unique approach to legato playing presented in this book, making him ideally suited to guide guitarists in mastering this essential technique.

## Complementary Titles
This book would complement Fundamental Changes' existing titles on lead guitar techniques and fretboard navigation, offering a deep dive into a specific and crucial aspect of guitar playing.

## Series Potential

This book is designed to stand alone as a comprehensive guide to fluid legato guitar techniques. However, it also has the potential to be the second in a two-book series or the middle volume in a three-book series on legato guitar playing. 

In a two-book series, this volume would build upon a foundational first book that introduces basic legato concepts, interval theory, and practical licks for immediate application. As the second book, it would then delve deeper into advanced techniques, fretboard navigation, and include full composed solos to demonstrate these concepts in a musical context.

In a three-book series, this book would serve as the bridge between introductory and advanced concepts. The first book could focus on fundamental legato techniques and music theory, while a third book could explore creative applications in composition and improvisation.

This scalable approach allows for flexibility in publishing strategy, catering to guitarists at various skill levels and providing a structured path for ongoing skill development.
