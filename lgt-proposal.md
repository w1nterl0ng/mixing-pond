The unique interval-based approach offers guitarists a new perspective on fretboard navigation and legato playing.

## Complementary Titles
This book would complement Fundamental Changes' existing titles on lead guitar techniques and fretboard navigation, offering a deep dive into a specific and crucial aspect of guitar playing.

## Series Potential

This book is designed to stand alone as a comprehensive guide to fluid legato guitar techniques. However, it also has the potential to be the second in a two-book series or the middle volume in a three-book series on legato guitar playing. 

In a two-book series, this volume would build upon a foundational first book that introduces basic legato concepts, interval theory, and practical licks for immediate application. As the second book, it would then delve deeper into advanced techniques, fretboard navigation, and include full composed solos to demonstrate these concepts in a musical context.

In a three-book series, this book would serve as the bridge between introductory and advanced concepts. The first book could focus on fundamental legato techniques and music theory, while a third book could explore creative applications in composition and improvisation.

This scalable approach allows for flexibility in publishing strategy, catering to guitarists at various skill levels and providing a structured path for ongoing skill development.
